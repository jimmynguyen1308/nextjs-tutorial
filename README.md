# NextJS Tutorial by [`@jimmynguyen1308`](https://github.com/jimmynguyen1308)

This repository is a [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) issuing the basics of developing a NextJS application. The tutorial will guide you through the basics of NextJS (file structure, additional features, etc.) compared to ReactJS in order to help you upscale from the traditonal React application to a newly up-to-date server-side-rendering-supported NextJS application.

## Features & Concepts

The tutorial runs through NextJS's basic concepts and features including:
- File-based routing
- Pre-rendering (including getStaticProps, getStaticPaths & getServerSideProps)
- API setup & deployment
- Basic styling & SASS support

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
